## Introduction

**OLLO Station** is a trading platform, network, and sovereign L1 chain built on [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com) and the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk), providing next-gen trading tools and sustainable [tokenomics](https://docs.ollo.zone/about/tokenomics). Our all-in-one decentralized exchange platform will provide a diverse suite of advanced, automated tools that go beyond the basic capabilities of order book trading, staking, bonding, and portfolio control. 

We're working to provide users with full automated control over their assets, positions, stakes, bonds and rewards throughout the Cosmos ecosystem and beyond. We are professional traders, developers, DeFi scientists and dedicated individuals focused on continuous & sustainable DeFi innovation. Our philosophy is built on the idea that the best tools of today are just a glimpse into the possibilities of tomorrow.

We're currently in the testnet phase of our development. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pVCk6BDS) or follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OLLOStation) account for updates.
