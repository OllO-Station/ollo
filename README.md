## Welcome Aboard 🤝

**OLLO Station** is a trading platform, network, and sovereign L1 chain built on [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com) and the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk), providing next-gen trading tools and sustainable [tokenomics](https://docs.ollo.zone/about/tokenomics). Our all-in-one decentralized exchange platform will provide a diverse suite of advanced, automated tools that go beyond the basic capabilities of order book trading, staking, bonding, and portfolio control.

We're working to provide users with **full control and automation** over their assets, positions, stakes, bonds and rewards throughout the Cosmos ecosystem and beyond. We are professional traders, developers, DeFi scientists and dedicated individuals focused on continuous & sustainable DeFi innovation. Our philosophy is built on the idea that the best tools of today are just a glimpse into the possibilities of tomorrow.

Currently, we're in the testnet phase of our development. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pVCk6BDS) or follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OLLOStation) account for updates.

## Getting Started ⚡

### Joining the Testnet

- **For a full walkthrough** on creating an address, joining the currently running testnet (`ollo-station-1`), and acquiring tokens from the testnet faucet, visit our [documentation](https://docs.ollo.zone). Further questions can be brought to OLLO Station's [Discord](https://discord.gg/pVCk6BDS).

### Creating a Validator

If you're looking to come on board as a validator or full network node, we recommend the following system prerequisites:

- Ensure you have [Make](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/) and [Go 1.19+](https://golang.org/dl/) installed
- Ensure you have adequate storage (256GB+) and memory (8GB+ RAM) to run a validator/full node
- For a **full, detailed walkthrough** on setting up a node and/or validator, visit our official [documentation](https://docs.ollo.zone).

### Installing the Node

First, clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/OllO-Station/ollo.git
```

To build the node, run the command:

```bash
make build
```

To install the node on your local machine, run the command:

```bash
