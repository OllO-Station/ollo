## Introduction

**OLLO Station** is a sovereign L1 chain built on [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com) and the [Cosmos SDK](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk), providing next-gen trading tools & sustainable [tokenomics](https://docs.ollo.zone/about/tokenomics). Our all-in-one design decentralized exchange platform will provide a suite of advanced, automated tools that expand on the basic capabilities of order book trading, staking, bonding, & portfolio control. We're working to provide users with full, automated control over their assets, positions, stakes, bonds & rewards on all connected cosmos chains. We are professional traders, developers, DeFi scientists and dedicated individuals focused on continuous & sustainable DeFi innovation. Our philosophy is built on the idea that the best tools of today are just a glimpse into the possibilities of tomorrow.

We're currently in the testnet phase of our development. Join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/pVCk6BDS) or follow our [Twitter](https://twitter.com/OLLOStation) account for updates.
