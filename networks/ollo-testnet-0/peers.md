# Active Peer List
For bootstrapping an OLLO network node, you can copy the `addrbook.json` file in this directory to your local OLLO node directory with the following command:

```bash
wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OllO-Station/ollo/master/networks/ollo-testnet-0/addrbook.json
mv addrbook.json ~/.ollo/config/addrbook.json`
```

An updated list of active peer addresses on the network is also provided below
