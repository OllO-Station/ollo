 # State Transitions

This document describes the state transaction operations for the farming module.

## Plans

As stated in [Concepts](01_concepts.md), both public and private farming plans are available in the `farming` module:

- A public farming plan can be created only through governance proposal.
- A private farming plan can be created with any account. 


```go
// PlanType enumerates the valid types of a plan.
type PlanType int32

const (
    // PLAN_TYPE_UNSPECIFIED defines the default plan type.
    PlanTypeNil PlanType = 0
    // PLAN_TYPE_PUBLIC defines the public plan type.
    PlanTypePublic PlanType = 1
    // PLAN_TYPE_PRIVATE defines the private plan type.
    PlanTypePrivate PlanType = 2
)
```

## Stake

When a farmer stakes an amount of coins, the following state transitions occur:

- Reserves the amount of coins to the staking reserve account for each staking coin denom `address.Module(ModuleName, []byte("StakingReserveAcc|"+stakingCoinDenom))` 
- Creates `QueuedStaking` object and stores the staking coins in `QueueStaking`, which then  wait in a queue until the end of epoch to move to the `Staking` object
- Imposes more gas if the farmer already has `Staking` with the same coin denom. See [Parameters](07_params.md#DelayedStakingGasFee) for details.

## Unstake

When a farmer unstakes an amount of coins, the following state transitions occur:

- Adds `Staking` and `QueueStaking` amounts to see if the unstaking amount is sufficient
- Automatically withdraws rewards for the coin denom that are accumulated over the last epochs
- Subtracts the unstaking amount of coins from `QueueStaking` first, and if not sufficient then subtracts from `Staking`
- Releases the unstaking amount of coins to the farmer

## Harvest (Reward Withdrawal)

- Calculates `CumulativeUnitRewards` in `HistoricalRewards` object in order to get the rewards for the staking coin denom that are accumulated over the last epochs 
- Releases the accumulated rewards to the farmer if it is not zero and decreases the `OutstandingRewards`
- Sets `StartingEpoch` in `Staking` object

## Reward Allocation

If the sum of total calculated `EpochAmount` (or `EpochRatio` multiplied by the farming pool balance) exceeds the farming pool balance, then skip the reward allocation for that epoch.

For each [abci end block call](https://docs.cosmos.network/master/modules/staking/05_end_block.html), the operations to update the rewards allocation are:

- Calculates rewards allocation information for the end of the current epoch depending on plan type `FixedAmountPlan` or `RatioPlan`
- Distributes total allocated coins from each planâ€™s farming pool address `FarmingPoolAddress` to the rewards reserve pool account `RewardsReserveAcc`
- Calculates staking coin weight for each denom in each plan and gets the unit rewards by denom
- Updates `HistoricalRewards` and `CurrentEpoch` based on the allocation information
- Deletes `QueueStaking` object after moving `QueueCoins` to `StakedCoins` in the `Staking` object
