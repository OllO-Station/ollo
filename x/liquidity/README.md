# The OLLO Liquidity moduleliquiditiiy

This module defines the liquidity pool transaction and querying logic. This module is still in very early development as we begin our testnet launch. The initial scaffolding is graciously borrowed from the hard work of the Crescent team's liquidity module, as we continue to expand and implement our own AMM and intelligent liquidity pool logic.
